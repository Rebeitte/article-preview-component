## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- 
### What I learned

I learned how to use the event "Click" to control the DOM using javascript, this learped me a lot to control the when the share box appears on the page. 

### Continued development

For the next projects I want to focus on the javascript learning (mainly in functions), also I'll be using SASS for the next project.
